Armoured*
This could be chitinous plates or bark, or something else. It cancels Small Arms or Hand-to-Hand Expertise when an Operator is taking them out due to the protection it offers. It can also make the the threat more inclined to throw itself into the attack and add a Risk Die.
Berserk Rage*
It takes 1 extra Stress to finish a threat with this Power; they simply don’t notice the harm being done to them. Control can spend HEAT to add another Stress, extending the rage or its depth. They are also more dangerous in a fight, hence the option to add a Risk Die.
Cloak of Darkness
This sheathes the target in darkness that makes it difficult to target them and may allow them to achieve surprise. It might confer the ability to travel in a mortal’s shadow.
Discover Desire
This could cancel Expertise when an Operator is trying to lie to or manipulate a threat. Control will ask the Operator about their desire at that moment, and they are compelled to answer honestly. This could provide fictional positioning for the threat to make an offer the Operator might struggle to resist unless they succeed in a roll to do something else.
Elemental Blast*
This is the channelling of an element or force against the Operators. Chilling cold or heat could do Operators harm and add a Risk Die. Darkness, Leaves or Light could distract them and cancel Expertise.
Fly
Control will say whether this involves feathered, bat or insect wings, or levitation etc. It creates fictional positioning to move a confrontation into a third dimension, put the threat out of reach, or deny an Operator the option to chase them down.

Glamour
This is the power of appearing as someone, or something, else. Threats may use this to conceal their true form, in which case it’s often paired with Shocking true form. It is a perfect cover; they are that person, until they choose to reveal themselves or, at Control's discretion, they become very angry or distracted. Usually, they must reveal their true form to use their other Powers openly, though Control will be the final judge of that.
Grant Power
This allows a Supernatural to endow a mortal with a Power. Control will decide if this benefit is paired with a Weakness. It is possible that one Conspiracy faction could grant a Power to an Operator confronting their rivals. However, supping with the devil requires a long spoon and Operators should beware costs in the form of Weaknesses that change who they are.
Great Speed
They can shorten range from close to intimate in one action and they cancel Operator Expertise during flee for their life or chase them down so long as the Operators are on foot.
Great Strength*
They always win a trial of strength with a single Operator and are more dangerous in a fight. Control will judge how much they can change the fiction by bringing down walls or throwing heavy items around a scene.
Inhuman Senses
These make it more difficult for an Operator to maintain their cover by hiding as all the threat’s senses are preternaturally acute. Animal sense is a more limited application appropriate to a particular animal: the low light ‘vision’ of a bat, a wolf’s sense of smell, the ability of an insect to detect scent at very long range, etc.

Incorporeal
This resembles Invisible but does not usually render the threat entirely transparent. Control will say if this is a permanent state or one it can adopt at will or at a certain time of the day or in particular locations. If the threat can materialize at will, then the shock of its appearance would constitute surprise. Physical barriers mean nothing when incorporeal and neither does gravity. The legend of vampires turning to and from mist is covered by this, though it may mean they can only move through gaps, however small, rather than through solids.
Invisible
This is very similar to Incorporeal but an Operator certainly can’t see them and they can’t attack something they can’t see other though they might attack with an area weapon. It is for Control to say whether IR goggles or other aids could help and if this is a permanent state or not. While it may be more trouble than it’s worth, Control can say that they are invisible only to artificial image capture such as film or digital cameras.
Mesmerism
This may require eye contact or may be via a psychic connection, but it turns an innocent bystander into a meat puppet pawn. Control will judge whether the threat can control more than one mortal at a time but a crowd of previously innocent bystanders after blood presents a dramatic and challenging moral (and morale) issue to Operators.
In the name of game balance this can only target one Operator at a time. They can resist by rolling to do something else but with the option to mark Stress in place of failure. The HEAT marked with a failure might reflect the threat learning something about them or the team. Operators who refuse the option to mark Stress and accept the fail can always try to break the link by rolling when Control judges the fiction has changed. The link is also automatically lost if the threat is sufficiently distracted, perhaps by a convenient Compulsion or being shot at.
Open Portal
This provides a threat with an instant exit from a scene without any chance of pursuit unless Control wants the Operators to follow them into Hell or the Fae Otherworld, or to their vampiric fastness.

Poltergeist*
This can simply unnerve an Operator or see them facing a hail of dangerous objects which will certainly distract them from the task at hand and which may put them at risk of harm.
Possession
This works a little like Mesmerism but can only target one bystander or Operator at a time. If the threat was visible, it disappears creating the fictional positioning for a threat to be carried by a mortal as a passenger, only materializing when it chooses to or when tempted forth. Each time it seeks to control the actions of a possessed Operator they can roll to do something else to displace it. Generally, once evicted the threat cannot possess the same mortal again, at least not in the same scene.
Project Desire or Emotion
The Supernatural can project a desire or emotion onto an Operator, provoking one of the seven deadly sins or a strong emotion of the threat’s choice in an innocent bystander or Operator. An Operator can resist this in the way they can resist Mesmerism unless the threat has already forced them to reveal themselves with Discover Desire, in which case every outcome from do something else requires them to mark an extra Stress to resist doing what the possessing threat demands.
Regenerate
While mundane weapons appear to do harm, the effect is transitory. Control says how quickly Stress applied by mundane weapons recovers. If it is before the Operators’ eyes, then they should erase one Stress after everyone has taken an action as wounds seal themselves and bones reset. It’s still possible to fill the Stress track if Operator’s can cooperate to apply Stress very quickly and Control will judge if this drives the threat out of the scene, but mundane damage never finishes it.
Dismembering or burning the threat to ashes only causes a greater delay in their regeneration unless a Vulnerability has been targeted. Their regeneration simply requires more time ‘off-screen’. Perhaps a ritual must be performed, or a sacrifice offered. For vampires this may be time in their grave soil soaked in fresh blood, for demons it might require penance in Hell while for fae it might require the balm of time in the Otherworld.
Wherever and how ever it occurs, there should be a cut scene confirming to the players that it’s just a matter of time before it returns. The cut scene should also ensure they know there have been some consequences to innocents of their failure to finish the job. Perhaps we see the blood being ‘harvested’, or the demon or fae ‘at play’ with a mortal.
See in the dark
This puts Operators at a disadvantage even if they have a flashlight, though night vision googles, or floodlights will usually put the Operator back on an equal footing.
Shapechange
It is for Control to say, but bats, wolves, plants or swarms of rats or insects are all possibilities depending on the nature of the Conspiracy. This Power can be used to make the threat look harmless, as a means of surprise, or to escape, depending on circumstances. Turning into a swarm of locusts will make the threat difficult to hit (see Summon & command swarm).
Shocking True Form
Some Supernaturals appear mortal but must reveal their true form to use their Power. The demon can’t benefit from their insect carapace until they manifest in it, for instance. Seeing the true form will require Operators who see it to roll for Stress.
Spider climb
This allows the threat to move up walls and along ceilings as easily as across open flat ground.
Spit venom*
This is one of the (mercifully) few ways a threat can attack from beyond Intimate range unless they make use of mundane weapons. Control will say if it does anything other than sting like hell and require a successful roll to do something else to resume normal actions, or cause temporary blindness, creeping paralysis or some other narrative effect.
Stench of Fear
Control will say how wide an area is affected and whether it’s a literal stench or just an aura. Control will also say if a successful roll to do something else is necessary to ignore it so Expertise ceases to be cancelled.

Summon & Command Animals
... such as a pack of hounds, wolves, or a murder of ravens. The summoned animals can be treated like a group of nameless mortals though they are likely to outnumber any single Operator. The sudden growth of a thorny hedge or the animation of vines can be treated in the same way, unless Control says they just slow Operators down and distract them until a machete or Molotov is used.
Summon & Command Swarm
... of rats, bats, insects, small birds or even clouds of plant seeds or fungal spores. These are impossible to hit with a bullet so swarms should either be avoided or run from, unless the Operator can deploy fire or something with a similar area effect against them. They can force Operators to split up or drive them towards a more serious threat. Control will say if they draw blood or clog mouths or noses, in which case a roll to take them out them will be necessary during which only the Operator is at risk unless they have a means to do the swarm harm.
Summon & Command Servitors
This introduces a Supernatural from that tier of the Conspiracy into the scene, though there must be reasonable fictional positioning to do so. A vampire can only summon the zombies of its victims if they are at hand, while a gifted Occultist might need a body to summon its shade.
Teeth & Claws
These represent the default weapons of most supernaturals and includes ‘bare hands’. Those with the right form factor can use mundane weapons.
Teleport
This is similar to Great speed but operates for line of sight, allowing even greater distances to be covered in the blink of an eye and reducing Operators’ opportunity to attack at range before the threat gets to Intimate range. It may also make it impossible to chase them down.
Track
... by scent, psychic connection, blood, or by communing with nature spirits along the route an Operator has taken, or perhaps anywhere in a location the threat knows well. Control will say which depending on the nature of the Conspiracy. This is likely to make it more difficult to flee for your life or maintain your cover, so Expertise would be cancelled.

Venomous*
This adds an extra Risk Die to Teeth & Claws but with the potential to have effects similar to Spit Venom.
Wards, Bindings & Spells
It is for Control to say how this works, but threats could use it to imbue an object, location or threshold with another Power which is activated when an Operator triggers it. This if the default Power of an Occultist.
