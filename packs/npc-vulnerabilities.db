This means there’s a chance to end the threat when it is still 3 Stress away from being finished rather than 2.\nIf the Fae are Vulnerable to bronze and Precise Strike: Beheading, then the appropriate Double Tap becomes ‘beheading with a bronze edged weapon’. Obtaining a bronze kukri should be a challenge, but it means Control announces that the Fae Crown is now 3 Stress from being finished so the next roll to take them out could be the one! If the success isn’t brilliant, then there’s another action for the Crown to escape with one Stress remaining.\nIf vampires in the game are vulnerable to Extreme Deterrence: Fire, then combining that with Precise Strike: Heart could create the Double Tap ‘impaling their heart with a thermite pencil’.\nIf demons have a gem in their forehead that must be destroyed by a Precise Strike, then the team can leverage their vulnerability to Weapon of Faith: the Blessed Sword of Gabriel into the Double Tap ‘destroying their gem with Gabriel’s sword’.\nBoth Precise Strike and another appropriate Vulnerability must already be in play before INTEL can be spent to define the detail of the Double Tap.Whatever material the threat is vulnerable to it should be difficult to get without additional INTEL spends or a call on a Contact.

It might take several attempts before the team has a plan that successfully holds the threat in the scene long enough to finish it.\nGiven the potency of such a weapon it should be very hard to find. The team might have to confirm it even exists, work out where it has lain for the last few centuries, and then finally defeat any guardians protecting it.
